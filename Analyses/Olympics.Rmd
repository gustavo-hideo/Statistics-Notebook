## Background

Come up with an interesting question about the olympics and answer it here using good statistical analysis and a powerful graphic... (delete this line). <!-- or comment it out -->



```{r, warning=FALSE}
# Code to get you started. 
# Only the first 100 observations are shown here because the dataset is really too big to show all of it in a markdown file.
datatable(head(Olympics,100), options=list(lengthMenu = c(3,10,30)), extensions="Responsive")
```



```{r}

```
